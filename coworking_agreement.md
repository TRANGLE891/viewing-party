# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*

We each clone the project, we also shared VS Code Live Share, and we discuss time to meet outside of class time. 

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

We will work independently for part of the time, and we will come together to share what we accomplished. We will use VS Code Live when we work together, and we will see Slack's Huddle to co-working.  

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*

We have discussions together and try to understand the README instructions and follow the steps. 

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*

We will be straight forward about what each of us did, and find out a solution together while being kind and polite to each other. 

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*

We want to be resepefctful to each other's solution, if we are in disacgreement/conflits we should come up with a solution that we botha agreed on, whether it is the coding or our communication method. 

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
